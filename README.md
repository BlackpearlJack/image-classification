# 🖼️ Image Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies deep learning and machine learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories. Using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier and image preprocessing techniques, the model is trained to recognize patterns and features for accurate classification.

## 🚀 Features
- Train an **SVM classifier** to categorize images
- Preprocess images (resizing, normalization, feature extraction)
- Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Interactive visualization of predictions

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Images manually downloaded from the web  
- **Size:** X images across Y categories  
- **Classes:** ['Class 1', 'Class 2', ..., 'Class N']  
- **Format:** JPG/PNG images  
- **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, converted to grayscale or RGB, and normalized before training
